## Introduction

Project Sato aims to redefine the way we think about command-and-control systems. By leveraging blockchain technology and decentralized protocols, we create a more resilient and secure environment for managing botnets. Our focus on censorship resistance ensures that users can maintain control over their systems without interference.

## Features

- **Decentralized Architecture**: Eliminate single points of failure with a distributed system.
- **Censorship Resistance**: Maintain functionality even in restrictive environments.
- **Post-Quantum Cryptography**: Prepare for the future with quantum-resistant algorithms.
- **Merkle Tree Implementation**: Ensure data integrity and efficient verification.
- **Smart Contracts**: Automate processes with Solidity-based contracts.
- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Enhance privacy while proving validity.
- **Relay Protocols**: Facilitate communication through Tor and other anonymizing networks.
